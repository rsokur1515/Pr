## Project Description
The aim of this project is to analyze the impact of foreign direct investments (FDI) and population growth on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country. We will explore the relationships between these variables and develop a measure that reflects the influence of FDI on GDP, taking into account the restraining effect of population growth.

## Data
We will use publicly available data on FDI, population size, and GDP from reliable sources such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

## Methodology
We will analyze the data using various statistical methods and tools, including correlation analysis, regression analysis, and visualization.

## Results
We expect to find a positive correlation between FDI and GDP, with a stronger effect observed in countries with higher population growth rates. Our measure of FDI's influence on GDP, adjusted for population growth, is expected to provide valuable insights into the relationship between these variables.

## Conclusion
The findings of this project will contribute to a better understanding of the factors that influence the economic development of countries.
